I'm a creative and dreamy mind based in Milan (but ready to move somewhere else in the world).

After a semester of study abroad in Berlin, I graduated with maximum grades in Communication Design in NABA, with a thesis focused on the concept of immersive experiences as a medium for brand communication.

After that I started working as Junior Art Director in Jungle, an unconventional communication agency working in the field of brand experiences, guerrilla marketing and launch events.

â€‹

I'm passionate about everything that is "to communicate": today we are seeing companies and artists going over the common boundaries of communication, blending virtual and real spaces and using technologies to create impactful experiences.

My objective is to become part of this change, creating new ways to communicate and discovering what will be the role of an Art Director in the future.
